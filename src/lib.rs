//! This crate enables the user to create a simple operating system by supplying interrupt handlers
//! for the timer and the keyboard. As time and energy permits, I may add other interrupt handlers
//! that seem useful.
//!
//! I developed this crate to support assignments in my operating systems course at Hendrix
//! College. It provides a nice introduction to bare-metal programming. It has not been
//! "battle-tested" in a production domain.
//!
//! The code is heavily derivative of the examples from the outstanding resource
//! [Writing an Operating System in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/). I would like to gratefully
//! acknowledge Philipp Oppermann's efforts to create this resource. Comments in each source file
//! specify which code elements I have adopted from him.
//!
//! Before attempting to use this crate, it is essential to read the following tutorials. In fact,
//! don't just read the tutorials; work through them! In particular, make sure to set up the
//! [x86_64-blog_os.json](https://os.phil-opp.com/minimal-rust-kernel/) file and the
//! [.cargo/config.toml](https://os.phil-opp.com/minimal-rust-kernel/) file as described therein.
//! - [A Freestanding Rust Binary](https://os.phil-opp.com/freestanding-rust-binary/)
//! - [A Minimal Rust Kernel](https://os.phil-opp.com/minimal-rust-kernel/)
//! - [VGA Text Mode](https://os.phil-opp.com/vga-text-mode/)
//! - [CPU Exceptions](https://os.phil-opp.com/cpu-exceptions/)
//! - [Double Faults](https://os.phil-opp.com/double-fault-exceptions/)
//! - [Hardware Interrupts](https://os.phil-opp.com/hardware-interrupts/)
//!
//! Having read and understood the ideas from the above tutorials, you can use this crate to create
//! your own Pluggable Interrupt Operating System (PIOS).
//!
//! Here is a very basic example (found in main.rs in this crate):
//! ```
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//!
//! use pc_keyboard::DecodedKey;
//! use pluggable_interrupt_os::HandlerTable;
//!
//! fn tick() {
//!     print!(".");
//! }
//!
//! fn key(key: DecodedKey) {
//!     match key {
//!         DecodedKey::Unicode(character) => print!("{}", character),
//!         DecodedKey::RawKey(key) => print!("{:?}", key),
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
//!     HandlerTable::new()
//!         .keyboard(key)
//!         .timer(tick)
//!         .start()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, we begin with our interrupt handlers. The **tick()** handler prints a period
//! on every timer event, and the **key()** handler displays the character typed whenever the
//! key is pressed. The **_start()** function kicks everything off by placing references to these
//! two functions in a **HandlerTable** object. Invoking **.start()** on the **HandlerTable**
//! starts execution. The PIOS sits back and loops endlessly, relying on the event handlers to
//! perform any events of interest or importance.
//!
//! As we can see from this example, the capabilities of your PIOS will be
//! limited to handling keyboard events and displaying text in the VGA buffer. Within that scope,
//! however, you can achieve quite a lot. I personally enjoyed recreating a version of a
//! well-known 1980s [arcade classic](https://github.com/gjf2a/ghost_hunter).
//!
//! Here is the main.rs from that program:
//! ```
//! #![no_std]
//! #![no_main]
//!
//! use lazy_static::lazy_static;
//! use spin::Mutex;
//! use ghost_hunter_core::GhostHunterGame;
//! use ghost_hunter::MainGame;
//! use pluggable_interrupt_os::HandlerTable;
//! use pc_keyboard::DecodedKey;
//!
//! lazy_static! {
//!     static ref GAME: Mutex<MainGame> = Mutex::new(GhostHunterGame::new());
//! }
//!
//! fn tick() {
//!     ghost_hunter::tick(&mut GAME.lock());
//! }
//!
//! fn key(key: DecodedKey) {
//!     GAME.lock().key(key);
//! }
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
//!     HandlerTable::new()
//!         .keyboard(key)
//!         .timer(tick)
//!         .start()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For this program, I created a
//! [GhostHunterGame struct](https://github.com/gjf2a/ghost_hunter_core/blob/master/src/lib.rs)
//! to represent the state of the game. It is wrapped in a **Mutex** and initialized using
//! [lazy_static!](https://docs.rs/lazy_static/1.4.0/lazy_static/) to ensure safe access. Nearly
//! any nontrivial program will need to make use of this design pattern.
//!
//! The **tick()** function calls a special
//! [ghost_hunter::tick()](https://github.com/gjf2a/ghost_hunter/blob/master/src/lib.rs) function
//! that handles details of drawing the game state in the VGA buffer. It also advances the ghosts
//! by one position.
//!
//! The **key()** function calls the **GhostHunterGame::key()** method to convey updates to game
//! state resulting from keypresses.
//!
//! This is a pedagogical experiment. I would be interested to hear from anyone who
//! finds this useful or has suggestions.
